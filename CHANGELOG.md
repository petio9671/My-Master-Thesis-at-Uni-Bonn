## [9.0.0] - 2021-07-01

The user interface for making the cover and title pages has been revamped.
The user should just need to say `\makethesistitle`.
The complicated steering that used to be in the main file has been moved to this macro.
See `thesis_skel/thesis_skel.tex` in order to implement the change in existing theses.

### Added

- New command `\makethesistitle` for cover and title pages.
- New macro `\thesisdedication` for dedication (if you want to include one).
  This hides the complicated steering that was in the thesis main file.
- `cover` directory also copied to `mythesis`. Useful if importing everything into Overleaf.
- Add some information about setting things up with Overleaf.
- Add font name and filename commands for LuaLaTeX and XeLaTeX.
- `fontname` option added to use font name rather than filename with LuaLaTeX and XeLaTeX.

### Changed

- Move bibliography after appendix.
- Tweak handling of `astrobib` bibliographies so they work better.

### Deprecated

### Removed

- Remove `cover_test` directory.

### Fixed

- `titlelowerback` for declaration and "Gutachter" works in `twoside=false` mode.
- Fix bold math font for Palatino.

### Security

- Turn off `dcolumn` by default, as there are (better) alternatives.
- Latest version of `PyFeynHand` scripts.
- `backref`, `maxbibnames` and `block` options actually work and should be passed to `ubonn-biblatex.sty`.
