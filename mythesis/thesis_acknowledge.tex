I would like to thank first and foremost my supervisors Prof. Dr. Stefan Krieg and Prof. Dr. Thomas Luu who introduced me into the field of Computational Physics. They gave me the incredible opportunity to work with them at Forschungszentrum Jülich on this project. 

I am extremely grateful to Dr. Evan Berkowitz, with whom I was closely working. His guidance and continuous support helped me throughout my master's thesis. I am also grateful for the excellent notes that Evan provided, which laid the groundwork for my thesis.

Special thanks to my colleagues Keshvi, Christoph, Johann, Nico, and Marcel for the ideas and suggestions in the meetings throughout the year. Especially Aleksandra Salkina who supported me throughout my whole Master's study. I also sincerely acknowledge the computing time granted through JARA on the supercomputer JURECA at Forschungszentrum Jülich.
