We have written the bulk of the high performance computing code which aims to generate the correlation function data. We have performed tests on the code to ensure that it produces the correct distributions. Once the program ran properly, I generated the raw data using JURECA cluster. While the simulations were running, we started writing the first scripts for basic data analysis. When the first batch of data was done and analyzed, the plotted data showed interesting results, but further investigation was still needed.
% The next steps in this project are to write more data analysis tools that will allow for better statistics and hopefully give us more insight into the energy spectrum of excitons.
