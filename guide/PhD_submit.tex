\section{Introduction}
Questions often come up when your thesis is finished and now you have
to print it and submit it. The \foreignquote{ngerman}{Promotionsbüro}
and the university library (ULB) have instructions on what you have to
do, but it is sometimes not clear what this means in terms of the
cover pages offered by this thesis framework.

For the printed version of your thesis, you probably want
\Package{hyperref} links and the table of contents to be black. In
order to do this, you should uncomment the \Macro{hypersetup} command
that is in the thesis main file, just after the
\Macro{usepackage}\texttt{\{mythesis/thesis\_defs\}}.
You should also decide if you want to keep the back references in the bibliography.

You can contact the ULB to get suggestions for print
shops that can make copies of your thesis in good enough quality to be
accepted by the university library.
